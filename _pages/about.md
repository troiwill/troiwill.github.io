I am a Computer Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the [RAAS Lab](https://www.raaslab.org) at the University of Maryland, College Park.

My **research interest** bridges robot (sensor) perception, planning, navigation, uncertainty, and concepts from the field of quality management.

My **long-term goal** is to build teams of robotic systems that can:

1. Reason about their perceptual capabilities.

2. Reason about the perceptual capabilities of others.

3. Plan how to strengthen or weaken such capabilities (i.e., either their perception or the perception of others).

For example, a robot could use a flashlight to search for spare tools in a dimly lit room, strengthening its ability to find them (see figure). In another case, a robot could use glare from lights to temporarily blind adversaries to avoid capture, weakening its adversaries' ability to see it.

Presently, I explore how perceptual factors impact downstream robotic tasks such as human-robot interaction, navigation, planning, and scene understanding.
