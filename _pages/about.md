I am a Computer Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the [RAAS Lab](https://www.raaslab.org) at the University of Maryland, College Park.

My **research interest** bridges robot (sensor) perception uncertainty, planning, navigation, and concepts from the field of quality management.

My **long-term goal** is to build robotic systems that can reason about their perceptual capabilities and plan how to optimize such capabilities individually or within a group.

Presently, I explore how perceptual factors impact downstream robotic tasks such as human-robot interaction, navigation, planning, and scene understanding.
