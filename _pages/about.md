👨🏾‍🔬 I am a Computer Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the [RAAS Lab](https://www.raaslab.org) at the University of Maryland, College Park.

🤖 My **research interest** bridges robot (sensor) perception uncertainty, planning, navigation, and concepts from the field of quality management.

📚 My **long-term goal** is to build robotic systems that can reason about their perceptual capabilities and plan how to optimize such capabilities individually or within a group.

👨🏾‍💻 Presently, I explore how perceptual factors impact robotic tasks such as human-robot interaction, navigation, and planning.
