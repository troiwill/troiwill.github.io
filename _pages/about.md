I am a Computer Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the [RAAS Lab](https://www.raaslab.org) at the University of Maryland, College Park.

My **research interest** bridges robot (sensor) perception, planning, navigation, uncertainty, and concepts from the field of quality management.

My **long-term goal** is to build teams of robotic systems that can: (1) Reason about their perceptual capabilities; (2) Reason about the perceptual capabilities of others; and (3) Plan how to positively or negatively impact such capabilities (i.e., either their perception or the perception of others).

Presently, I explore how perceptual factors impact downstream robotic tasks such as human-robot interaction, navigation, planning, and scene understanding.
